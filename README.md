# Read The Docs - Headstart

Based on "Read The Docs" at https://readthedocs.org/

Create, host, and browse documentation.

##  Free docs hosting for open source
We will host your documentation for free, forever. There are no tricks. We help over 100,000 open source projects share their docs, including a custom domain and theme.

## Always up to date
Whenever you push code to your favorite version control service, whether that is GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab, we will automatically build your docs so your code and documentation are never out of sync.

## Downloadable formats
We build and host your docs for the web, but they are also viewable as PDFs, as single page HTML, and for eReaders. No additional configuration is required.

## Multiple versions
We can host and build multiple versions of your docs so having a 1.0 version of your docs and a 2.0 version of your docs is as easy as having a separate branch or tag in your version control system.
